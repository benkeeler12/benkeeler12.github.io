        <p> Hello everybody! This website is dedicated to computer programming and the fascinating world that comes along with it.
            There will be multiple links that lead to additional websites about my progress in programming including the apps I create and other tools I learn.
            Also, there will be a section about myself so you can get to know me even better!</p>
